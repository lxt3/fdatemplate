fdatemplate
===========

The goal of fdatemplate is to distribute an rmarkdown Word template that
outputs a format for Word review memos.

Example
-------

Open a new Rmarkdown file, choosing fdatemplate as the template. After
filling in details and writing the review, “knit” the rmarkdown file
using the “knit to word” button at the top. A docx file will open with
your edits and the template structure.
